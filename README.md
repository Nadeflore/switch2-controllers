# switch2 controllers
An app to use switch 2 joycons on pc as gamepad and mouse


### Using as a mouse

By default the app switches a joycon to mouse mode when it detects it's being used a mouse (side of of the joycon against a flat surface)

When in mouse mode, the following buttons are used as mouse buttons and no longer useable as gamepad buttons :
L/R : left click
ZL/ZR : right click
joystick : mouse wheel and middle button (click)

If you do not wish to use mouse mode, you can disable it in the config

### Using joycons sideways

By default, the app will always try to combine a right and left joycons together to make a single virtual controller.

If you wish to use both joycons sideway, you can hold SL\SR while turning them on
An other option is to set `combine_joycons` in the config to false so that the app will never try to combine joycons
